# Firefox GNOME theme (but modified with my crappy code)


<br>

**A GNOME theme for Firefox**

This theme "doesn't" follows latest GNOME Adwaita style but rather only kinda does it.

## Description

Basically i just made a slight \(and crappy\) modification to his original theme to make it fit in slightly better with my desktop theme.
I mean the paddings look kinda goofy but no way am I smart enough to do this properly xd
Basically this just adds the custom titlebar buttons
